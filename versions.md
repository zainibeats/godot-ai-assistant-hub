* "Make floating" option (by right-click to the plugin tab) is now enabled in Godot 4.6 without need to do any manual code changes (closes #64).
* Thinking content is now obtained when it comes separate to the agent response and displayed accordingly to the user settings (Project Settings > General > Plugins > AI Assistant Hub > Thinking Target).
